## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).

## Contributing

This repository is the starter code for _all_ Udacity students. Therefore, we most likely will not accept pull requests.

## Description

The **goal of the game** is to match all cards on the deck. You can inspect two cards at once. If they match, they'll remain visible, if they don't, they will automatically flip back.

Your **moves** are counted and the **time** spent on the game is measured. You can choose to flip a card back, in this case _it won't count as a move_.

When you win, a **popup window** will inform you of your scores. You can choose to close this window and take a screenshot of your results. ;) 

The **star rating** goes down by _each 5 moves_ you've "used up".
