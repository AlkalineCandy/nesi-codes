# Memory Game Project

## Context

This game is a Udacity learning project. The starter code can be found in the repo from which this one was forked. 

## Description

The **goal of the game** is to match all cards on the deck. You can inspect two cards at once. If they match, they'll remain visible, if they don't, they will automatically flip back.

Your **moves** are counted and the **time** spent on the game is measured. You can choose to flip a card back, in this case _it won't count as a move_.

When you win, a **popup window** will inform you of your scores. You can choose to close this window and take a screenshot of your results. ;) 

The **star rating** goes down by _each 10 moves_ you've "used up".
