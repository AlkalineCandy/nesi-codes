        <p>I'm Nesi. I need content for my sandbox and lorem ipsum is somewhat dull. This is an overview of what I do in my
            free time. And here is my social media in case you can't wait until the footer:

            </p>Hi! Please remember that this page is where I practice coding. If it looks sketchy or broken, then that's 100%
            normal; this is the nature of sandbox projects. I will fix everything as I proceed in the development process!

            <p>
                I have two mentors; Ruby and Snowcrash. Ruby is my "big picture" mentor and inspiration; he helped me set up my text editor
                and GitHub and this particular page on Netlify. Snowcrash was there when I started it all, and he is my support
                with the technical, miniscule struggles that occur in the coding process. I'm very grateful for them. Thank
                you!
