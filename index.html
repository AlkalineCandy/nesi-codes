        <p>I'm Nesi. I need content for my sandbox and lorem ipsum is somewhat dull. This is an overview of what I do in my free time. And here is my social media in case you can't wait until the footer:

        <h1>  Acknowledgements</h1> <p>
 I have two mentors; Ruby and Snowcrash. Ruby is my "big picture" mentor and inspiration; he helped me set up GitHub, Atom, and this particular page on Netlify. Snowcrash was there when I started it all, and he is my support with the technical, miniscule struggles  that occur in the coding process. I'm very grateful for them. Thank you! <i class="fa fa-child" aria-hidden="true"></i> </p></div>

        <table> <tr> <td class="td_name">HTML</td> <td class="td_content">In Hungarian, "span" is a slang for a friend. Let's just say HTML and I are <span class="font">	&lsaquo;span&rsaquo;</span>s. </td> </tr>
        <tr> <td class="td_name">CSS</td> <td class="td_content"> I follow <a href="https://twitter.com/anatudor">Ana Tudor</a> on Twitter because I admire her "CSS only" codes. It's mindblowing how much you can achieve if you know a bit more than just basic CSS. CSS masters need no JavaScript. Only a preprocessor. And that's very independent! </td> </tr>
    <tr> <td class="td_name">JavaScript</td> <td class="td_content"> One of the most defining moments of my coding adventure was when I did my first clickable, toggleable button with JS. The feeling when you did something and <em>the browser responds</em>... That's when I decided to grit my teeth through all errors and missing semicolons. Because the result is always exhilarating. </td> </tr>
  <tr> <td class="td_name">DOM & jQuery</td> <td class="td_content"> They are part of the Udacity Front End Web Dev course where I'm a Google Scholarship recipient, so I have no choice but to learn them. And then manipulate every DOM I come across.</td> </tr>
<tr> <td class="td_name">Sass</td> <td class="td_content"> Without a doubt, Sass has the wittiest name out of all languages out there. My boyfriend and I are making a webpage for my mother (it's a Christmas gift), and it's built on <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, so I feel like it's the perfect opportunity to familiarize myself with this cutie. </td> </tr>  </table>

                    <p>My research interest is evangelicalism in Hungary. My Master's thesis was about the political themes that make it to the forefront of Hungarian evangelical discussions. I kind of plan to write an easy-to-read book about this.</p>
                      <p> I'm also interested in the good and fair treatment of </p>

                        <p> Academic and political topics in general are likely to make me chatty. I think everybody should have opinions on political matters, so if you've got one, I'm happy to listen. </p>

                    <p>I walk every day! Minimum 5 kilometers, but preferably more. I get very sad when I don't get to do it. It makes me feel physically and emotionally stronger. I keep track of my distance and my steps with a phone app. Maybe when I'm
                        very skilled at programming, I can put the graph overview in here so that you see my awesome stats.
                    </p>
                    <p> I'm super fond of biking too. I have a bike tattoo even. It's on my right thigh so don't worry if you hate tattoos; you won't have to see it. Biking in Budapest is great, and one of my favorite summers was when we went on a bike trip around the Lake Balaton with my friends.</p>

                    <p>I code because it's fun.</p>
                    <p> It's fun to be in control! When you code, there is no external factor to blame. If it works, it's your success. If it doesn't, it's on you to fix it. I started to code in the summer of 2017 and it soon became an important free time
                        fun for me.</p>
                    <p> I'm currently enrolled in the <strong>Google Scholarship for the Udacity Front-end Web Development Nanodegree</strong>, so I now have a lot of soon-to-be programmer acquaintances. It's really inspiring.

                    <p> I spend even more time with my boyfriend. He thinks it's cute when I code, so I figured he'd wanna see himself in my HTML. I give him credit for getting livid at my barbaric JavaScript mistakes. Thank you.

                    <p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Playdate/">Playdate</a> is a gamer community. They've got a Discord group where I pretend to be a moderator. I have surprisingly fond feelings for this group of people. Despite being rough around the edges, they are extremely supportive, and full of pretty intelligent people. We don't have this typical problem that the community is close-knit and thus impossible to penetrate for newcomers. We are hella open. If you ever feel like playing video games or just finding some new friends, just check the link and join our Discord group. And this promo text was genuine I promise.
